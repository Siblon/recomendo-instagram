# Recomendo Instagram

This repository contains a small Chrome extension used for automating interactions on Instagram. The extension injects a script that follows profiles and likes photos from the followers modal.

## Usage

1. Load the `recomendo-instagram` directory as an unpacked extension in Chrome.
2. Open Instagram and click the extension icon.
3. In the popup, click **Iniciar Bot** to run the automation.

The extension logs actions directly on the page and provides a button to stop the automation at any time.

Use responsibly and at your own risk.
